## About This Book

When a young Coast Guard surfman is falsely branded a coward by his superior, he risks everything to clear his name on the fog-shrouded shores of Cape Cod. Caught between duty and honor, Aubrey Sears must confront smugglers, treacherous colleagues, and his own doubts in a desperate fight that will determine not only his future in the service but his chance at love. In the shadowy world of Prohibition-era rum-runners and opium smugglers, one man's courage will expose a web of lies that reaches to the heart of his own station.
